# Shaping change through play

	## Hi, we are Wil and Ben from e.pilot
I would like to share a part of my story with you to 
---
### The journey to be here today
By that I mean the succession of events that progressed towards being here on stage today. I left Brazil years ago for Sweden, where I met a funny Italian guy named Andrea. Maybe he has something to do with my presence here today. Anyway, after that I changed cold Sweden for the slightly less cold Germany, where I got my first job abroad; and that's when the story for today starts.

### Being on the move posed some challenges
I joined the product development team of a digital healthcare start-up in Germany, the culture shock was big. Let me tell you, those people are conservative. To give you a reference: I mean FAX conservative. It was not always easy to connect to people. So much was different, I felt the barriers, I felt insecure. Luckily for me, I had Ben who made it easier. But still, I didn't want it to be a silo.

	### First ever team event

In that context, a bit less than 6 months in the job I had the first team event at that company. I would spend 3 days uninterruptedly with my colleagues, 24/7 in a remote place in the German countryside. I did not feel very connected personally. I felt a bonding experience was needed and I had an idea.

#### I had an idea

It was a hit. Turned out eating, drinking and pushing humor boundaries was a success as a bonding experience. The game was played to exhaustion. It was not only enjoyable as a game, but it enabled people to start conversations about topics that would normally not come up and laugh about it. Suddenly in one night they were sharing more than months at work before.

	### A while later... something happened
	Covid-19
A lot changed. We used to be in the same physical space daily, not anymore. Remote work was made the default as a company policy. Hiring full-remote workers was now possible. We had open positions for a long time, with that they started being filled. With people who we would not meet in person. Not for the interview, not for daily work; at best once a year. Bonding became again a challenge, but now a different one.

	### We took the learning, games work
	#### How could we enable it remotely?
After some months in full remote work. The social drought hit. It started to feel boring, mechanic. Working with people who you only knew superficially. We started looking for alternatives to improve that, how could we make it better in the new setting. It is not hard, you can find easily find platforms to play it remotely. But we saw the chance to add our own flair to it.

### Enter game customization

We decided we could not only play the existing game, but add 
our own cards to it. Since the game has only 2 parts, black and white cards, you can easily create your own. We put a spreadsheet in the cloud and shared for everyone to write down their ideas. Very simple: a column for prompts and a column for responses. We could then render them as cards or even print them out. That's a courtesy of Robert Middleton who developed playingcards.io

### It didn't take long until we had interesting combinations

As you can see, this combination shows some frustration from the player. The fact it was considered funny and chosen the winner of the round makes it clear it was a feeling shared by all the team. Naturally you are assuming already this was one of our projects, but what is Taron?

/assets/TARON Onride - Klugheim - Phantasialand.mp4
This is Taron. It's the fastest multi-launch roller coaster in the world, located in Phantasialand in Germany. The first launcher accelerates you from 0 to 80km/h. Then you go through a tunnel at that speed and think you're going fast enough. But remember I said "first" launcher. At this point you hit the second, that boosts you again, this time to 117km/h.

---
	### Alright, but why was the project named after Taron?
You might have guesses. But let's take a look at cards again, we got a good answer too.

Here you go. Project Taron originally only had a number as a name, but it received the kind nickname for the manner the team was forced into overdrive to meet the requirements for a contract sales had closed without aligning on the feasibility. It was sell first, figure it out later.

### Nevertheless, we made it.

So nobody was happy with it, that was clear. It was completely barebones, usability was comparable to the 90s web. Scope was kept to the minimum to check items off a list, only enough to fulfil the contractual terms. For the users, it was cumbersome to work with it. For developers, it was a pain to maintain and improve.

### From the cards to the board
	The talk with upper management
Based on the conversation started in the game and evident frustration of the team, we needed to find a way to prevent this situation of becoming recurrent. As a team, we did not have direct influence on the decisions made by sales and therefore we needed to make aware the people who had.

When distributing work, we had 2 options. Either the team would be assigned to maintenance tasks, fixing bugs and assuring the systems were running as expected. Maintenance work, being recurrent, would steadily block that capacity. Otherwise, the assignments could be about improving the existing features. By refining our system, as these improvements were done we could not only improve the system to our users but also free some of the capacity that would be committed to maintenance. Now the catch: by rushing new features like we did with Taron, on top of the time needed to work on it, we were also creating a maintenance commitment upfront since the quality of the delivery was below standard. If that loop would continue, the team would reach a point of having no capacity whatsover to work on improvements *neither* the new features, but needed for growth. Our message was: by focusing on short-term gains, we put a long-term limitation on ourselves.

Now if you look at the diagram used to illustrate this this, has anyone seen something similar before? What I just described resembles a system archetype, in this case the "limits to growth". These archetypes are common systemic behaviour patterns, and when put to use they can help bring to light how the parts of a system influence one another. They are essentially templates to diagnose recurring problems. Now I do not mean if you frame your situation in an archetype you are going to have a magic solution, but it helps in understanding the causes, the symptoms and the alternatives to mitigate it.

## Quick recap
Quick recap: we figured we could use a game to create a safe space where people could surface their frustrations. When looking to the causes of this frustration we found a recurrent, systemic problem. By bringing them up, we could frame these as an archetype in our organizational system and identify what should be changed. Worth mentioning, this is an example of one archetype. There are others you can check out on: {{source}} that are helpful to frame different behaviours and identify the variables involved.

But once having that, how do we change these variables? As you probably already know, it is not easy as promoting change often has different layers of complexity.
